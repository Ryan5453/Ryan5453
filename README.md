## Hi, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer from Massachusetts. I'm also a Northeastern University student who is currently on co-op working as a Computational Modeling Engineer at Montai Theraputatics while persuing my B.S. in Computer Science. I love writing software and contributing to open-source projects in my free time. I'm primarily focused on [Flowery](https://flowery.pw) and [SingingWhisper](https://github.com/Ryan5453/singingwhisper) at this time.
