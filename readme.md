I'm a software and infrastructure engineer currently pursuing my bachelor's in computer science at Northeastern University. I previously worked as a computational modeling engineer at [Montai Therapeutics](https://montai.com) on co-op.

I'm passionate about building robust, scalable infrastructure and exploring the world of machine learning, especially in areas like speech synthesis, automatic speech recognition, and large language models. I find the intersection of these interests particularly fascinating. I have a [portfolio](https://ryan.science) containing more information about my projects (including some closed source ones not listed here) and a [blog](https://ryan.science/blog) where I write about things that interest me.

I am looking for co-op opportunities from January 2026 to August 2026.
