Hi! I'm a software and infrastructure engineer currently pursuing my bachelor's in computer science at Northeastern University. I previously worked as an MLOps & Infrastructure Engineer at Montai Therapeutics on co-op.

My [portfolio](https://ryan.science) site contains more information about my projects (including some closed source ones not listed here) and a [blog](https://ryan.science/blog).
